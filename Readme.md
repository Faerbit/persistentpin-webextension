#PersistentPin WebExtension

This WebExtension is a rewrite of the
[App Tab Initializer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/app-tab-initializer) 
addon. It makes sure that on opening the browser there are the same websites
open and pinned.

If you have any problems or a suggestion feel free to open an issue.
